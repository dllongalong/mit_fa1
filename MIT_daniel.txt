Angular 2.0 is made keeping in mind mobile oriented architecture. There are libraries i.e. 
Native script which help mobile Angular 2 mobile development fast. 
Build Truly Native Mobile Apps with Angular NativeScript. 
It also render same code in different way on browser as well as on mobile app.

TypeScript:
TypeScript(TS) is used heavily in Angular 2. Google currently using DART for coding. 
DART or TypeScript can be used for Angular 2. Learning TypeScript is very good since other frameworks and libraries i.e. 
REACTJS is also using TS. Hence if one can learn TS itâ€™s very easily to implement REACTJS and other libraries in project.

If any developer is coming from JAVA, .NET background TypeScript is very easy to learn.

No $Scope in Angular 2:
Angular 2 is not using $scope anymore to glue view and controller. 
This is one of the biggest problem when you did coding in Angular 1 and then want to try Angular 2 for the project. 
However if anyone is coming from JAVA, .NET/ background can easily pick up because syntax are more similar to Java.
Angular 2 has very powerful routes. The Angular 2 Router will only load components when it absolutely needs them.
